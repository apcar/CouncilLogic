# Changelog

All notable public changes to Model Council are recorded here.

## [0.2.0a1] - 2026-07-26

Initial public alpha.

### Added

- Four-lineage OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and Mistral council with independent
  proposals, blinded structured juries, deterministic Borda aggregation, and
  synthesis.
- Deterministic credential-free mock mode and a resumable SQLite audit record.
- Single-user live CLI with official-host restrictions, environment or
  external-command credential resolution, quorum controls, bounded logical
  call budgets, and explicit exports.
- Mock-only, loopback-only HTTP service with six fixed reference principals,
  action-scoped mandates, owner-scoped reads and idempotency, durable
  invocation reservations, token rotation and revocation, restart recovery,
  and single-writer fencing.
- Standard-library test suite, packaging checks, immutable-action CI, security
  and operations guidance, research grounding, and public project templates.

### Boundaries

- This is an alpha, not a production service or a correctness claim.
- The HTTP service cannot use live providers and must remain on loopback.
- Both reference work principals are forced disabled.
- Audit content is plaintext; there is no automatic redaction or retention.
- Logical call limits are not provider billing or monetary cost ceilings.
- External pull requests and copyrightable contributions remain closed until
  a counsel-reviewed contributor license agreement is available.
